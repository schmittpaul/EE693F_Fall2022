## Details
This is a course designed for students who have an interest in academic research as well as students who seek to develop creative systems problem-solving skills that are necessary for the next generation of engineers and developers. We will take a tour of a variety of contemporary research topics, with an eye towards not only learning something about the individual topics, but also dissecting what makes for successful solutions. Networked systems privacy and security is quite broad, which is one of its appeals - privacy/security issues arise in any area, and privacy/security is difficult.

## Prerequisites 
Prior coursework in networking and operating systems or consent of the instructor.
